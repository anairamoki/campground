# YelpCamp
Creating my 1st big Project. 
The project consists in creating a website where users can create and review campgrounds. 

An account is required to access the campground website.

# This project was part of Colt Steele's web dev course on udemy where I am his student.

This project was created using 
• Node.js
• Express
• MongoDB
• Bootstrap. 
• Passport.js was used to handle authentication.
