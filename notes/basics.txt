1st init npm <npm init -y>
2nd install npm i express ejs mongoose
3rd create app.js
4th require to use express.
5th create a 3000 PORT - app.listen (3000 ...)

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from YELP CAMP!')
})

* check if the message 'Hello from YELP CAMP!' is appearing

9th create a views directory
10th create a home.ejs in the views directory and create a page
11th in the app.js set up the app.set('view engine', 'ejs'), set the 'view engine' to be ejs
12th do an app that sets views dir ('views')
13th require a path and set the views to be path joint
14th res.render('home')

note: 
To set up a view engine, the middleware needs to be written in app.js: 

app.set('view engine', 'ejs'); // 11th step
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'))

where path is the global object and __dirname holds current directory address. Views is the folder where all the web pages will be kept.
