** Multer **
Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.

In order to parse data - files - (enctype="multipart/form-data") we need to use a middleware called MULTER. (express/multer)

on new.ejs file do the following: 
1 - add  enctype="multipart/form-data" in the form 
<form action="/campgrounds" method="POST" novalidate enctype="multipart/form-data" class="validated-form">

enctype="multipart/form-data" - is an encoding type that allows files to be sent through a POST. 

2 - create a newinput tag whithin a form. 
<input type="file" name="image" id="" multiple> 
multiple =  allows to upload multiple images. 
leave it blank if it is a single image upload.  
<input type="file" name="image" id=""> 

on campgrounds.js file routes/campgrounds
.post(upload.array('image'),(req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body, req.files);
    res.send("It worked!")
  })

upload.array('image') - upload multiple images at once
upload.single('image') - upload single image at once. 

** cloudnary **
Is a server where we can store the images

It gives an API Key and API secret. To store the API's credentials or secret keys inside of our application we use a hidden file. So when we send out our project to GitHub, this hidden file won't be sent. 
This hidden file stays locally in our machine and it's called dotenv.
