JOI is a JS validator tool.
Basically, you define a schema for some thing, some data in JavaScript.
So for our schema will basically be for the request body (req.body) and  can be validated, and make sure that campground is there as an object or title is a string and it's an alphanumeric string.

npm i joi

campgroundSchema -> validate basic schema to validate data before to save it with Mongoose. THIS IS NOT A Mongoose SCHEMA!


Once the schema is defined, pass the data through to the schema.
 const result = campgroundSchema.validate(req.body); -> campground.Schema validates req.body and save the results.
