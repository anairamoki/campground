** Setting up Mongoose **

Connect Mongoose in the app.js file and passing options
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/yelp-camp') - yelp-camp -> DB name

options: useNewUrlParser: true,
  //useCreateIndex: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,

21st - DB logic.
db variable was set to mongoose.connection <const db = mongoose.connection;>

Note: MongoParseError: option usecreateindex is not supported.
When the usecreateindex is removed the DB works. 
This is why: 
The mongoose package just recently updated to version 6.x after years, and the useCreateIndex property is no longer required to dismiss some warnings. If you're both using the updated version, you can remove that line without any issues. 

an alternative: 
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/yelpCampDb', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
    .then(() => {
        console.log("MONGO CONNECTION OPEN!!!")
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.log("Error, MONGO CONNECTION!!!!")
        console.log(err)
    })





On terminal open mongo. 
1st type: mongo
2nd type: use yelp-camp
3rd type: db.campgrounds.find()
