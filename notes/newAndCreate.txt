Creating a New campgrounds and saving them into Campground DB


41st - in the new.ejs create a form.
name="campground[title]" - inside input tag.
campground[title] - when the data is sent to DB via POST request to  express app to the server, everything in the request body(req.body) will be stored under campground.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:

in the APP.JS

When creating NEW ROUTE it needs to come first the show route. Because there's an app to get campground ID <app.get('/campgrounds/:id'...>. 
If the NEW ROUTE is after SHOW ROUTE, the ('campgrounds/new') be treating the new as the ID. 



- ending point - where the POST REQUEST is submitted (button)- app.js
