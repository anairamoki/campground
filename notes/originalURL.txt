if (!['/login', '/register', '/'].includes(req.originalUrl)) {
    console.log(req.originalUrl);//originalUrl - where the request comes from
    req.session.returnTo = req.originalUrl;

** logic explained **
if the user is not comming from login, register and home page, includes the original URL(req.originalUrl).
if you are in login, register and home page and send a POST request, is going to check where are you comming from. If comming from login, register and home,  the user will be redirect to campground page
if (!['/login', '/register', '/'].includes(req.originalUrl)) {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
if the user is comming from anywhere else, return to original URL
req.session.returnTo = req.originalUrl;
