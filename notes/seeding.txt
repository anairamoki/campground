the file will be running on its own everytime we want to access the db

25th - removing everything in the db

26th - require to use cities.js

27th - creating new Campground -> location: `${cities[random1000].city}, ${cities[random1000].state}`
getting a city and a state from cities.js and random it using the variable created <const random1000> in the for loop

28th - requiring to use seedHelpers.js

29th - getting random descriptors in random places and putting them together

array[Math.floor(Math.random) * array.length] - Pick a random number and multiply by the lenght of the array and floor that and then access that out of array

const sample = array => array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
So you pass in the array and we return a random element from that array.

30th - closing the db
